Currently, this project is severely undermanned. Our current policy is not to waste much (ideally, *any*) man-hours on meaningless formalisms. And, to be clear, *releases are mostly a meaningless formalism.* A release is simply a snapshot of the code at any particular point in time.

JavaCC 21 should be a very attractive project for people to get involved in, either as a user (the typical case), or as a developer. The reason it could be very attractive to a user is that, at at this stage of things, we have such a desire 


## Needed Clarification

Now, to be clear, we do understand that, in the case of very large systems, like the JFK or the Linux Kernel or whatever, all this stuff about releases and versioning becomes quite important. This is particularly true if you are integrating a large number of subsystems. However, for projects of a quite moderate scale, like FreeMarker or JavaCC, which are what I will be working on mainly in teh coming period, this stuff is mostly like a swamp you can get stuck in.

Much of this dates back to the pre-Internet days of shrink-wrapped software. How

However, the real origin of this is by analogy with the engineering of hard physical products. If you bought a washing machine in 2018, it was presumably the 2018 model. Or maybe the 2017 model. This can be resolved by checking the serial number and so forth. But you have whatever model you have and you can't go to Github and "check out" the latest one. Ergo, there has to be technical support for the model you actually own.
