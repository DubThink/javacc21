## JavaCC 21 Roadmap



1. Repository of generally useful grammars that can be INCLUDE'd in new projects.

2. Clean up remaining cruft from the legacy JavaCC implementation.

3. Make the parser generation more flexible in terms of creating fault-tolerant parsers for interactive tools and also improving user feedback, error messages for one thing.

4. Generalize the tool to output parsers in other languages. (Probably C# will be the first implementation.)
